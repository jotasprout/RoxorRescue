# RoxorRescue
Submission for #CallForCode
callforcode.org

Application and system for collaborative, offline-first, search and rescue. Users can track structures searched and store data about such S&R which can be shared and synced between users and (after it is developed) between teams of users.

In such a situation, #offlineFirst is a huge benefit.

Here is the current UI/UX concept I scrambled in Photoshop:

![Hamburger menu in upper-left will contain settings. Image icon in lower-right is for taking pix.]

Concept and purpose of app based on what is commonly referred to as the "Katrina X." The following image is from Wikipedia:

![Each diamond contains image about search(es) performed on the house.]

## IBM Cloud stuff used
- one of the IBM cloud things
- another IBM cloud thing

## Links to Call for Code related stuff
- Noodle thing
- My IBM Coder profile page or whatever

## Features - Current

### Current - Completed

### Current - In Development
- Use camera to take photo for BG and confirmation of address by comparing to data and other photos
- X-Code overlaid onto image of structure

### Future - Near
- Hold up device camera toward structure for address (using device sensors, geolocation, and potential APIs)
- Could incorporate data and interactive UI via augmented reality in personell equipment
- Indications of areas with power outages and/or power returned
- Displays map of area based on an API
- Shows user location on map
- Indicates which houses have been searched (complete or incomplete) via "filled" or "empty" outline (first idea is these outlines are based on those in GoogleMaps)
- Set a region to search by creating polygon path on GoogleMap (or whatever)
- Method to create region (at the moment, I think) is pressing four (or three or five) streets to enclose an area on the map
- Above method creates list of structures
- Above list used to confirm addresses and display completion (percent and/or X of Y)
- Assign a region to a S&R team
- Data stored on local device
- Data syncs with other users (essential)

### Future - "Far"
- Data from all devices and teams consolidated in single database
- Remote, central can see and manage all teams, team members, and regions (optional, for orgs and locales with required infrastructure) and data
